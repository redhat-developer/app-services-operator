  description: Using the OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka cloud service in your OpenShift cluster
  prerequisites: 
    - Access to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka (for more information, visit https://cloud.redhat.com/application-services).
    - A running OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance.
  introduction: >-
    ### This quick start shows you how to connect Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka to OpenShift.
    
    In this Quick Start, you'll connect your OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka cloud service to your OpenShift cluster using the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services 
    Operator. For more information on Red Hat OpenShift Application Services, please visit [cloud.redhat.com.](https://cloud.redhat.com/application-services)
  tasks:
  - title: Connect your OpenShift instance to your Red Hat OpenShift Application Services
    description: |-
      The Red Hat OpenShift Application Services operator allows you to represent Red Hat Cloud Services as first class citizens in your OpenShift environment.
      This enables you to work and integrate with these services using standard OpenShift/Kubernetes features and APIs.
            
      To connect your OpenShift project to your Red Hat OpenShift Application Services, follow these steps:

      1. Click on the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}} at the top of the navigation, and select **Developer**.

      1. In the navigation menu, click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}.
 
      1. Click on the **Managed Services**  card. This will open the **Managed Services** catalog.
      
          Before we can user our Application Services in OpenShift, we need to configure OpenShift to have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services environment. We can `unlock` access to the service by providing our API key.

      1. Click on the **Red Hat OpenShift Application Services** (RHOAS) card. This will open the RHOAS side-panel.

      1. In the side-panel, you will find a link to retrieve your API token for **cloud.redhat.com**.
          1. Click on the link. This will navigate you to the **cloud.redhat.com** token page.
          1. Copy the token to your clipboard by clicking on the **Copy to clipboard** icon next to the tokenb.
          1. Paste the token in the **API Token** field in the RHOAS side-panel.
      
      1. With the API Token entered, click on the **Connect** button.

      1. Your **Red Hat OpenShift Application Services** are now unlocked. The **Managed Services** catalog now contains the cards for the various Red Hat cloud services that you can connect to.

        #### Verify that you've successfully connected to Red Hat OpenShift Application Services:
        Do you see the **Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka** card in the **Managed Services** catalog?

    description: |-
      Now that you've unlocked the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services, you can start connecting your Services to your OpenShift instance.
            
      In this Quick Start we will create a connection to your Streams for Apache Kafka instance. To do this:

      1. Click on the **Streams for Apache Kafka** tile in the **Managed Services** section of your **Developer Catalog**. This screen should still be open, it is the screen on which we ended the previous task.

      1. In the side-panel you are presented with a description and overview of the service. Click on the **Connect** button at the top-left of the side-panel.

      1. You will be presented with a list of Streams for Apache Kafka instances that you have access to. Select the Kafka instance that you want to connect to your OpenShift instance and click on the **Create** button at the bottom of the screen.

      1. The **Topology** view is opened and will show the Kafka instance that you've connected to your OpenShift namespace.

        #### Verify that your Kafka instance connection was successfully created:
        Do you see your connected Kafka instance in your topology view?
      failedTaskHelp: This task isn't verified yet. Try the task again.
    summary:
      success: >-
        Great work! You've connected your Streams for Apache Kafka cloud service to your OpenShift project/namespace.
      failed: Try the steps again.

  - title: Inspect the Kafka connection details
    description: |-
      With your Streams for Apache Kafka instance bound to your OpenShit project/namespace, you can now connect your application to it.
            
      This can be done in different ways.
      * You can inspect the connection details of your Kafka instance and configure your application to connect to it.
      * You can use OpenShift/Kubernetes Service Binding to bind your application to the service and have the connection details and credentials automatically injected into your application.

      1. If you're not already in the **Topology** view, in the navigation menu, click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.

      1. In the *Topology** view, click on the icon of your OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance. This will open a side-panel with detailed information about your Kafka instance.

      1. In the side-panel, click on the **Details** tab. This will provide you with the following information:
          1. **Bootstrap server**: address which the Kafka client connects tp.
          2. **URL**: link to your Streams for Apache Kafka instance on cloud.redhat.com

    review:
      instructions: |-
        #### You have all the necessary information to connect your application to your OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance:
        Have you seen the Bootstrap Server hostname and port?

        Do you have the credentials to connect to your Kafka instance?

        Do you know which authentication mechanism (SASL/PLAIN, SASL/OAUTHBEARER) to use?
      failedTaskHelp: This task isn't verified yet. Try the task again.
    summary:
      success: >-
        Great work! You've connected your Streams for Apache Kafka cloud service to your OpenShift project/namespace.
      failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: >-
    You've successfully created a connection between a Red Hat managed cloud service and your OpenShift project/namespace.
    You can now start using this Kafka instance in your applications, for example by binding the service to a Quarkus microservice.
