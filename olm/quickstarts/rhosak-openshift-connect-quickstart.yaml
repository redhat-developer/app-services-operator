  description: Connecting an OpenShift project to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using the RHOAS CLI
  prerequisites:
    - You have a Red Hat account.
    - You’ve created a Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) and the instance is in the **Ready** state.
    - The RHOAS Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster.

  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows how to use the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) CLI to connect a project in an OpenShift cluster to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka.

    As a developer of applications and services, you can connect applications running on OpenShift to Kafka instances in Streams for Apache Kafka. Specifically, you can use a specialized Operator called the Service Binding Operator to automatically provide an application with the parameters required to connect to a Kafka instance. This process is called *service binding*.

    Before you can bind an application running on OpenShift to a Kafka instance in Streams for Apache Kafka, you need to connect the Kafka instance to the appropriate project in your OpenShift cluster. To make this connection, you can use the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) CLI and RHOAS Operator.

    #### Prerequisites
    - You have a Red Hat account.
    - You’ve created a Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) and the instance is in the **Ready** state.
    - The RHOAS Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster.

  tasks:
    - title: Running the required CLI tools
      description: |-
        In this task, you'll deploy an image provided by Streams for Apache Kafka to create a new application in your OpenShift project. The application runs all of the CLI tools required to complete this quick start. The image includes the following tools:

        * The Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) CLI (`rhoas`)
        * The OpenShift CLI (`oc`)
        * The OpenShift Developer CLI (`odo`)

        Alternatively, you can install the CLI tools locally on your computer. For instructions on installing the tools, see the following resources:

        * [Installing the RHOAS CLI](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/f520e427-cad2-40ce-823d-96234ccbc047#_8818f0d5-ae20-42c8-9622-a98e663ff1a8)
        * [Installing the OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli)
        * [Installing the OpenShift Developer CLI (odo)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/installing-odo.html)

        **NOTE**: If you've already deployed the tools image provided by Streams for Apache Kafka, or you've installed the CLI tools locally on your computer, you don't need to complete the remainder of this task. Click **Next** to skip to the next task in the quick start.

        #### Prerequisites
         - You can access your OpenShift cluster with privileges to create a new project.

        #### Procedure

        1. Ensure that you're logged in to the OpenShift web console as a user who has privileges to create a new project in the cluster.

        1. Click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}. Switch to the **Developer** perspective.

           The **Topology** page opens.

        1. Create a new project.

            i. At the top of the **Topology** page, click the **Project** drop-down menu. Select **Create Project**.

            ii. In the **Name** field of the **Create Project** dialog box, enter a unique name, for example, `my-project`.

            iii. (Optional) Add details for **Display name** and **Description**.

            iv. Click **Create**.

        1. Deploy the CLI tools image provided by Streams for Apache Kafka.

            i. Click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}.

            ii. On the **Add** page, click **Container images**.
                The **Deploy Image** page opens.

            iii. For the **Image name from external registry** option, enter `quay.io/rhosak/rhoas-tools`.

            iv. For the **Runtime icon** option, select `openshift`.

            v. Under **Advanced Options**, *clear* the **Create a route to the Application** check box. For all other options, keep the default values.

            vi. Click **Create**.
                The **Topology** page opens.
                You should see an icon for the tools application you created. After some time, OpenShift completes the deployment. If you hover over the icon for the application, the resulting hover help should show that the application is in a **Running** state.

        1. Click the icon for the tools application.

           A sidebar opens with the **Resources** tab displayed. Under **Pods**, you should see a single pod, corresponding to the tools application.

        1. Click the link to the pod.

           The **Pod details** page opens.

        1. On the **Pod details** page, click the **Terminal** tab.

           A command-line window opens inside the pod.

        1. To check whether you can access the required tools, on the command line, enter `rhoas`.

           The `rhoas` command should show help text for the RHOAS CLI.

      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that you successfully created the tools application in your project
           * Did you see the RHOAS CLI help text on the command line of the pod for the tools application?
        failedTaskHelp: This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.

      summary:
        success: >-
            You successfully deployed an image provided by Streams for Apache Kafka to create a tools application in your project. You're ready to verify connection between the RHOAS Operator and your OpenShift cluster.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Checking RHOAS Operator connection to your OpenShift cluster
      description: |-
        In the previous task, you created an application in your OpenShift project that runs all of the CLI tools required to complete this quick start. In this task, you'll check whether the RHOAS Operator is working by using a command in the RHOAS CLI to connect to the OpenShift cluster and retrieve the cluster status.

        **NOTE**: By default, when you use the `rhoas login` command to log in to the RHOAS CLI, the CLI starts a sign-in flow in your web browser. However, the command line in the pod for your tools application doesn't have access to a browser. Therefore, in this task,
        you'll log in to the RHOAS CLI using a token.

        #### Prerequisites
         - You've created an application in your project that runs the required CLI tools.
         - The RHOAS Operator is installed on your OpenShift cluster.

        #### Procedure

        1. In the OpenShift web console, click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}. Switch to the **Developer** perspective.

           The **Topology** page opens.

        1. Ensure that the current OpenShift project is the one you created earlier in this quick start.

            i. At the top of the **Topology** page, click the **Project** drop-down menu.

            ii. Select the project that you previously created.

        1. If you don't already have a command-line window open in the pod for your tools application, open one, as described earlier in this quick start.

        1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI using a token.

            i. In the upper-right corner of the console, next to your user name, click the drop-down menu. Select **Copy login command**.
               A new page opens.

            ii. Click the **Display Token** link.

            iii. In the section entitled **Log in with this token**, copy the full `oc login` command shown.

            v. On the command line, paste the login command you copied. Right-click on the command line and select **Paste**. The following code shows an example.

            **Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a token**
            ```
            $ oc login --token=sha256~0WJOGcha7EOAkCmJpSSb6pyo2EawSUwZJKDEw3c-Ox4 --server=https://example.com:6443
            ```
            You should see output confirming that you're logged in to your OpenShift cluster and the current project that you're using. The current project should be the one that you set earlier in this task.

        1. Log in to the RHOAS CLI using a token.

            i. In your web browser, open the [OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token) page.

            ii. On the OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token page, click **Load token**. When the page is refreshed, copy the API token shown.

            iii. On the command line, log in to the RHOAS CLI using the API token you copied.

            **Logging in to the RHOAS CLI using a token**
            ```
            $ rhoas login --token=<token>
            ```
            In the preceding example, replace `<token>` with the API token that you copied. To paste the token that you copied, right-click on the command line and select **Paste**.

        1. Use the RHOAS CLI to connect to your OpenShift cluster and retrieve the cluster status.

           **Using the RHOAS CLI to retrieve the status of your OpenShift cluster**
           ```
           $ rhoas cluster status
           Namespace: my-project
           RHOAS Operator: Installed
           ```
           As shown in the output, the RHOAS CLI indicates that the RHOAS Operator was successfully installed. The CLI also retrieves the name of the current OpenShift project (namespace). In this example, the current project is called `my-project`.

      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that you checked the connection between the RHOAS Operator and your OpenShift cluster
          * Did you see `RHOAS Operator: Installed` when you executed the `rhoas cluster status` command?
          * Did you see the current OpenShift namespace listed when you executed the `rhoas cluster status` command?

    - title: Connecting a Kafka instance to your OpenShift cluster
      description: |
        In the previous task, you verified connection between the RHOAS Operator and your OpenShift cluster. You're now ready to connect a Kafka instance in Streams for Apache Kafka to the current project in the cluster.

        #### Prerequisites

        - You’ve created a Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) and the instance is in the **Ready** state.
        - You've verified connection between the RHOAS Operator and your OpenShift cluster.
        - You have an API token to connect to your Kafka instance. To get a token, see the [OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token) page.
        - You understand how Access Control Lists (ACLs) enable you to manage how user accounts and service accounts can access the Kafka resources that you create. For more information, see [Managing account access in Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_streams_for_apache_kafka/1/guide/2f4bf7cf-5de2-4254-8274-6bf71673f407).

        #### Procedure

        1. In the OpenShift web console, click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}. Ensure that you're using the **Developer** perspective.

        1. Click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.

        1. Ensure that the current OpenShift project is the one you created earlier in this quick start.

            i. At the top of the **Topology** page, click the **Project** drop-down menu.

            ii. Select the project that you previously created.

        1. If you don't already have a command-line window open in the pod for your tools application, open one, as described earlier in this quick start.

        1. If you opened a new command-line window, log in to the OpenShift CLI using a token, as described earlier in this quick start.

        1. If you opened a new command-line window, log in to the RHOAS CLI using a token, as described earlier in this quick start.

        1. Use the RHOAS CLI to connect a Kafka instance in Streams for Apache Kafka to the current OpenShift project.

           **Using the RHOAS CLI to connect a Kafka instance to your OpenShift cluster**
           ```
           $ rhoas cluster connect
           ```
           You're prompted to specify the service that you want to connect to OpenShift.

        1. Use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the `kafka` service. Press **Enter**.

           You're prompted to specify the Kafka instance that you want to connect to OpenShift.

        1. If you have more than one Kafka instance, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the instance that you want to connect to OpenShift. Press **Enter**.

        1. Review the information shown by the RHOAS CLI. When you're ready to continue, type `y` and then press **Enter**.

           You're prompted to provide an access token. The RHOAS Operator requires this token to connect to your Kafka instance.

        1. In your web browser, open the [OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token) page.

        1. On the OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token page, click **Load token**. When the page is refreshed, copy the API token shown.

        1. On the command line, right-click and select **Paste**. Press **Enter**.

           The RHOAS Operator uses the API token to create a `KafkaConnection` custom resource object on your OpenShift cluster. When this process is complete, you should see lines similar to the following example:

           **Example output from rhoas cluster connect command**
           ```
           Service Account Secret "rh-cloud-services-service-account" created successfully
           Client ID: srvc-acct-8c95ca5e1225-94a-41f1-ab97-aacf3df1
           ...
           KafkaConnection resource "my-kafka-instance" has been created
           Waiting for status from KafkaConnection resource.
           Created KafkaConnection can be injected into your application.
           ...
           KafkaConnection successfully installed on your cluster.
           ```
           As shown in the preceding output, the RHOAS Operator creates a new service account to access your Kafka instance in Streams for Apache Kafka. The Operator stores the service account information in a secret.

           The RHOAS Operator also creates a `KafkaConnection` custom resource object for your Kafka instance, which connects the instance to the OpenShift cluster. When you bind your Kafka instance to an application on OpenShift, the Service Binding Operator uses the `KafkaConnection` custom resource object to provide the application with the necessary connection information for the instance.

        1. Set Access Control List (ACL) permissions to enable the new service account created by the RHOAS Operator to access resources in your Kafka instance. To set permissions, use the `Client ID` value for the service account.

           **Setting access permissions for the service account**
           ```
           $ rhoas kafka acl grant-access --consumer --producer \
           --service-account srvc-acct-8c95ca5e1225-94a-41f1-ab97-aacf3df1 --topic "*" --group "*"
           ```
           You're prompted to create the ACL permissions.

        1. To create the permissions, type `y` and then press **Enter**.

           The command you entered allows applications to create and delete topics in the instance, to produce and consume messages in any topic in the instance, and to use any consumer group and any producer.

        1. Use the OpenShift CLI to verify that the RHOAS Operator successfully created the connection.

           **Using the OpenShift CLI to verify Operator connection to your cluster**
           ```
           $ oc get KafkaConnection

           NAME   		         AGE
           my-kafka-instance     2m35s
           ```
           As shown in the output, the RHOAS Operator creates a `KafkaConnection` custom resource object that matches the name of your Kafka instance. In this example, the name of the `KafkaConnection` object matches a Kafka instance called `my-kafka-instance`.

        In general, you can connect an application to the Kafka instance in one of these ways:
        * Inspect the connection parameters for your Kafka instance and manually configure the application to connect to the instance.
        * Use the Service Binding Operator to automatically provide the application with the connection parameters required to connect to the Kafka instance.

        In this task, you'll inspect the connection parameters required to *manually* connect an application to your Kafka instance.

        #### Prerequisites
         - You've connected your Kafka instance to a project in your OpenShift cluster.

        #### Procedure

        1. In the OpenShift web console, click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}. Ensure that you're using the the **Developer** perspective.

        1. Click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.

        1. Ensure that the current OpenShift project is the one you created earlier in this quick start.

            i. At the top of the **Topology** page, click the **Project** drop-down menu.

            ii. Select the project that you previously created.

        1. If you don't already have a command-line window open in the pod for your tools application, open one, as described earlier in this quick start.

        1. If you opened a new command-line window, log in to the OpenShift CLI using a token, as described earlier in this quick start.

        1. Use the OpenShift CLI to get the name of the `KafkaConnection` resource created in the previous task.

           **Using the OpenShift CLI to get the name of the KafkaConnection resource**
           ```
           $ oc get KafkaConnection
           ```

        1. Use the OpenShift CLI to retrieve the details of the `KafkaConnection` resource.

           **Using the OpenShift CLI to get the details of the KafkaConnection resource**
           ```
           $ oc describe KafkaConnection/<kafka-connection-name>
           ```

           In the preceding example, replace `<kafka-connection-name>` with the name of your `KafkaConnection` resource. When you press **Enter**, the output shows detailed information for the `KafkaConnection` resource.

        1. To *manually* configure an application to connect to the Kafka instance, collect the following required connection details:

            * **Bootstrap Server Host:** Bootstrap server endpoint of the Kafka instance, in the format of `<host name>:<port>`
            * **Sasl Mechanism:** Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism used by the Kafka instance for client authentication
            * **Security Protocol:** Protocol used by the Kafka instance to secure client connections
            * **Service Account Secret Name:** Name of the secret that contains the client ID and client secret required to connect to the Kafka instance

      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that you collected the details required to manually configure an application to connect to your Kafka instance
          * Did you find the **Bootstrap Server Host** field, with a value in the format of `<host name>:<port>`?
          * Did you identify the authentication mechanism (`PLAIN` or `BEARER`) that the Kafka instance is using?
          * Did you identify the security mechanism (`SASL_PLAINTEXT` or `SASL_SSL`) that the Kafka instance is using?
          * Did you find the name of the service account secret, in which the client ID and client secret are stored?

      summary:
        success: >-
         You've collected the connection details you need to manually configure an application in your OpenShift project to connect to your Kafka instance.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: >-
    Congratulations! You successfully connected a Kafka instance in Streams for Apache Kafka to a project in your OpenShift cluster.
    You're now ready to bind applications in the project to the Kafka instance.
