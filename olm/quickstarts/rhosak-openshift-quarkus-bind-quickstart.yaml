  description: Binding an application in OpenShift to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using the CLI
  prerequisites:
    - You've completed the **Connecting OpenShift to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using the CLI** quick start.
    - You have privileges to deploy applications in the OpenShift project that you connected your Kafka instance to.
    - Your Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) is in the **Ready** state.

  introduction: |-
      ### This quick start shows how to use the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) CLI to bind an example Quarkus application to a Kafka instance in Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka.

      As a developer of applications and services, you can connect applications running on OpenShift to Kafka instances in Streams for Apache Kafka. Specifically, you can use a specialized Operator called the Service Binding Operator to automatically provide an application with the parameters required to connect to a Kafka instance. This process is called *service binding*.

      In this quick start, you'll use the RHOAS CLI to instruct the Service Binding Operator to bind an example Quarkus application to a Kafka instance. [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is a Kubernetes-native Java framework that is optimized for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments.

      When you bind a Kafka instance with an application, the Service Binding Operator automatically injects connection parameters as files into the pod for the application. The example Quarkus application in this quick start uses the `quarkus-kubernetes-service-binding` [extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#service-binding), which means that the application automatically detects and uses the injected connection parameters. This eliminates the need for manual configuration of the application.

      #### Prerequisites
      - You've completed the **Connecting OpenShift to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using the CLI** quick start.
      - You have privileges to deploy applications in the OpenShift project that you connected your Kafka instance to.
      - Your Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) is in the **Ready** state.

  tasks:
    - title: Installing the Service Binding Operator
      description: |-
        To bind Kafka instances in Streams for Apache Kafka to applications on OpenShift, you need to install the Service Binding Operator on your OpenShift cluster. In this task, you'll install the Service Binding Operator.

        #### Prerequisites
        - You can access your OpenShift cluster with the `dedicated-admin` role (OpenShift Dedicated) or `cluster-admin` role. Only these roles have privileges to install an Operator on a cluster.

        #### Procedure

        1. Ensure that you're logged in to the OpenShift web console with the `dedicated-admin` role (OpenShift Dedicated) or `cluster-admin` role.

        1. Click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}.  Switch to the **Administrator** perspective.

        1. In the left menu, click **Operators** > **OperatorHub**.

        1. In the **Filter by keyword** field, enter `Service Binding`.

        1. In the filtered results, select **Service Binding Operator**.

           An information sidebar for the Service Binding Operator opens.

        1. In the sidebar, review the information about the Service Binding Operator and then click **Install**.

           The **Install Operator** page opens.

        1. On the **Install Operator** page, perform the following actions:

            i. For the **Update channel** option, select `beta`.

            ii. For the **Installation mode** option, ensure that `All namespaces on the cluster` is selected.

            iii. For the **Installed Namespace** and **Update approval** options, keep the default values.

            iv. Click **Install**.

         1. When the installation process is finished, click **View Operator** to see the Operator details.

            The **Operator details** page for the Service Binding Operator opens in the **Installed Operators** section of the web console.

            On the **Operator details** page, the **Status** field should show a value of `Succeeded`.
            Also, you should see that the Service Binding Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace.

      summary:
        success: >-
          You've installed the Service Binding Operator. You're ready to deploy an example Quarkus application.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Deploying an example Quarkus application
      description: |-

        In this task, you'll deploy an example Quarkus application in the same project that you previously connected your Kafka instance to.

        The Quarkus application generates random numbers between 0 and 100 and produces those numbers to a Kafka topic. Another part of the application consumes the numbers from the Kafka topic. Finally, the application uses *server-sent events* to expose the numbers as a REST UI. A web page in the application displays the exposed numbers.

        #### Prerequisites
        - You've completed the **Connecting OpenShift to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using the CLI** quick start.
        - You have privileges to deploy applications in the OpenShift project that you connected your Kafka instance to.

        #### Procedure

        1. Log in to the OpenShift web console with privileges to deploy applications in the project that you previously connected your Kafka instance to.

        1. Click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}. Switch to the **Developer** perspective.

           The **Topology** page opens.

        1. Ensure that the current OpenShift project is the one you previously connected your Kafka instance to.

            i. At the top of the **Topology** page, click the **Project** drop-down menu.

            ii. Select the project that you previously connected your Kafka instance to.

        1. Deploy the example Quarkus application.

            i. Click [Add]{{highlight qs-nav-add}}.

            ii. On the **Add** page, click **Container images**.
                The **Deploy Image** page opens.

            iii. For the **Image name from external registry** option, enter `quay.io/rhoas/rhoas-quarkus-kafka-quickstart`.

            iv. For the **Runtime icon** option, select `quarkus`. For all other options, keep the default values.

            vi. Click **Create**.
                  The **Topology** page opens.
                  You should see an icon for the Quarkus application you created. After some time, OpenShift completes the deployment. If you hover over the icon for the application, the resulting hover help should show that the application is in a **Running** state.

           vii. Click the **Open URL** link in the upper-right corner of the icon for the application.
                  A web page for the Quarkus application opens.

        1. In your web browser, add `/prices.html` to the URL of the web page for the Quarkus application.

           A new web page entitled **Last price** opens. Because you haven't yet connected the Quarkus application to your Kafka instance, the price value appears as `N/A`.

        1. In the OpenShift web console, click the icon for the Quarkus application.

           A sidebar opens with the **Resources** tab displayed. Under **Pods**, you should see a single pod corresponding to the Quarkus application.

        1. Next to the name of the pod, click **View logs**.

           In the logs for the Quarkus application, you should see warnings indicating that the application can't connect to Kafka. You'll establish this connection in a later task.

      review:
        instructions: |-

    - title: Creating a Kafka topic for your Quarkus application
      description: |-

        In the previous task, you created an example Quarkus application that uses a Kafka topic called `prices` to produce and consume messages. In this task, you'll create the `prices` topic in your Kafka instance.

        #### Prerequisites
        - Your Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) is in the **Ready** state.

        #### Procedure

        1. In your web browser, open the [Kafka Instances](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/kafkas) page of the Streams for Apache Kafka web console. Click the name of the Kafka instance that you want to add a topic to.

        1. Click **Create topic** and follow the guided steps to define the topic details. Click **Next** to complete each step and click **Finish** to complete the setup.

           Specify the following values:

            **Topic name**: ```prices```.

            **Partitions**: ```1```.

            **Retention time**: ```1 day```

            **Replicas**: By default, this option is preconfigured to `3` replicas and `2` minimum in-sync-replicas.

        After you complete the topic setup, the new Kafka topic is listed in the topics table. You're now ready to bind the example Quarkus application to your Kafka instance, so that the application can use the topic to produce and consume messages.
      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that you successfully created the Kafka topic
           - Was the `prices` topic listed in the topics table?

          You successfully created the `prices` topic used by the example Quarkus application. You're now ready to bind the Quarkus application to your Kafka instance.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Binding the Quarkus application to your Kafka instance
      description: |-

        In this task, you'll use the RHOAS CLI to bind your Kafka instance to the example Quarkus application you created. When you perform this binding, the Service Binding Operator injects connection parameters as files into the pod for the application.

        The Quarkus application in this quick start uses the `quarkus-kubernetes-service-binding` [extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#service-binding). This means that the application automatically detects and uses the injected connection parameters.

        #### Prerequisites
        - You've completed the **Connecting OpenShift to Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka using the CLI** quick start.
        - You've deployed the example Quarkus application.
        - Your Kafka instance in [Streams for Apache Kafka](https://console.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/) is in the **Ready** state.
        - You've created the `prices` topic in your Kafka instance.

        #### Procedure

        1. Ensure that you're logged in to the OpenShift web console as the same user who deployed the Quarkus application in the previous task.

        1. Click the [perspective switcher]{{highlight qs-perspective-switcher}}. Switch to the **Developer** perspective.

           The **Topology** page opens.

        1. Ensure that the current OpenShift project is the one you previously connected your Kafka instance to.

            i. At the top of the **Topology** page, click the **Project** drop-down menu.

            ii. Select the project that you previously connected your Kafka instance to.

        1. If you previously created a CLI tools application in your OpenShift project, open a command-line window as follows:

            i. In your project, click the icon for the tools application.
               A sidebar opens with the **Resources** tab displayed. Under **Pods**, you should see a single pod, corresponding to the tools application.

            ii. Click the link to the pod.
                The **Pod details** page opens.

            iii. Click the **Terminal** tab.
                 A command-line window opens inside the pod.

           If you installed CLI tools locally on your computer instead, open a command-line window in the normal way.

        1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI using a token.

            i. In the upper-right corner of the console, next to your user name, click the drop-down menu. Select **Copy login command**.
               A new page opens.

            ii. Click the **Display Token** link.

            iii. In the section entitled **Log in with this token**, copy the full `oc login` command shown.

            v. On the command line, paste the login command you copied. Right-click on the command line and select **Paste**. The following code shows an example.

            **Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a token**
            ```
            $ oc login --token=sha256~0WJOGcha7EOAkCmJpSSb6pyo2EawSUwZJKDEw3c-Ox4 --server=https://example.com:6443
            ```
            You should see output confirming that you're logged in to your OpenShift cluster and the current project that you're using. The current project should be the one that you set earlier in this task.

        1. Log in to the RHOAS CLI using a token.

            i. In your web browser, open the [OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token) page.

            ii. On the OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token page, click **Load token**. When the page is refreshed, copy the API token shown.

            iii. On the command line, log in to the RHOAS CLI using the API token you copied.

            **Logging in to the RHOAS CLI using a token**
            ```
            $ rhoas login --token=<token>
            ```
            In the preceding example, replace `<token>` with the API token that you copied. To paste the token that you copied, right-click on the command line and select **Paste**.

        1. Use the RHOAS CLI to instruct the Service Binding Operator to bind your Kafka instance to an application in your OpenShift project.

           **Using the RHOAS CLI to bind a Kafka instance to an application in OpenShift**
           ```
           $ rhoas cluster bind
           ```
           You're prompted to specify the Kafka instance that you want to bind to an application in your OpenShift project.

        1. If you have more than one Kafka instance, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the instance that you want to bind to an application on OpenShift. Press **Enter**.

           You're prompted to specify the application that you want to bind your Kafka instance to.

        1. If you have more than one application in your OpenShift project, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to highlight the `rhoas-quarkus-kafka-quickstart` example application. Press **Enter**.

        1. Type `y` to confirm that you want to continue. Press **Enter**.

           When binding is complete, you should see output similar to the following example:

           **Example output from binding a Kafka instance to an application in OpenShift**
           ```
           Using Service Binding Operator to perform binding
           Binding my-kafka-instance with rhoas-quarkus-kafka-quickstart app succeeded
           ```
           The output shows that the RHOAS CLI successfully instructed the Service Binding Operator to bind a Kafka instance called `my-kafka-instance` to the example Quarkus application called `rhoas-quarkus-kafka-quickstart`.

           OpenShift redeploys the Quarkus application. When the application is running again, it starts to use the `prices`topic that you created in your Kafka instance. One part of the Quarkus application publishes price updates to this topic, while another part of the application consumes the updates.

        1. Reopen the **Last price** web page that you opened earlier in this quick start.

        1. On the **Last price** web page, observe that the the price value is continuously updated. The Quarkus application is now using the `prices` topic in your Kafka instance to produce and consume messages.

        1. In the OpenShift web console, click [Topology]{{highlight qs-nav-topology}}.

        1. Click the icon for the Quarkus application.

           A sidebar opens with the **Resources** tab displayed. Under **Pods**, you still see a pod corresponding to the Quarkus application.

        1. Next to the name of the pod, click **View logs**.

           You now see that the Quarkus application has connected to a Kafka instance.

        1. On the same page of the console, click the **Details** tab. Scroll down until you see the **Volumes** section.

           Observe that there is a volume mounted on the `/bindings` path of the pod. This volume contains the files for individual connection parameters that the Service Binding Operator injected into the application.

           Because the Quarkus application uses the `quarkus-kubernetes-service-binding` [extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#service-binding), the application automatically detected and used the injected connection parameters.
