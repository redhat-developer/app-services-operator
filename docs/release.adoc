== Release Process

Our release process is automated via GitHub actions. Each release generates new OLM metadata with its container, an operator container, updates the OLM Catalog index container, and pushes all of these to link:quay.io/rhoas[the RHOAS Quay organization]. These releases are available on the `beta` channel in OperatorHub.

=== OLM metadata

The `olm/olm-catalog` directory is managed by our release scripts. It contains the metadata files which are hosted by the index container. Each bundle is released as a separate container image named `service-operator-bundle` with the version of the GitHub tag that triggered the release script. The `olm/autoupdate.sh` script maintains this metadata.

=== Operator Container

The Operator container includes the Quarkus appplication which is responsible for managing the custom resources. The operator container is built by link:https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image[Quarkus JIB]. The configuration is provided by link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/source/rhoas/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]. The link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L32[GitHub action release workflow] contains an example of these values being overidden to release the operator. 

=== OLM Catalog Index

The link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/olm/index.Dockerfile[index.Dockerfile] file is the build file for the OLM catalog index container. These all share the same version, autolatest. They are released as `quay.io/rhoas/service-operator-registry:autolatest` by the build job.


== Customizing the release

The OLM metadata, release scripts, and container build files are in the `/olm` directory. These are executed by a link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml[GitHub action]. Currently, they release  to the rhoas Quay organization. If you wish to deploy to your own repository for testing continue reading. If you are trying to make a release to the quay organization, push the tag, in semver format, to the link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator[bf2/operator] repository and the release will happen automatically.

=== OLM Directory Structure

The `olm` directory contains the `olm-metadata` directory necessary to recreate the index image, the `olm-templates` directory which is used to create new bundles, the `autoupdate.sh` script responsible for creating and updating the olm metadata, and the `index.Dockerfile` and `run_opm.sh` files which update the index. The `catalogsource.yaml` file is used by your cluster to install and update the operator via the Operator Marketplace.

=== Changing the container repository

Currently, we use the link:quay.io/rhoas[RHOAS Quay organization] container image repository. If you wish to deploy to your own organization you will need to update the link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/olm/catalogsource.yaml#L11[`catalogsource.yaml`] file to use your own image, as well as updating several build files. In the future we hope to parameterize this.

=== Update OLM Metadata

link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/olm/olm-template/manifests/rhoas-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml#L99[The Clusterserviceversion] file has a reference to the operator container. This should be updated with your container repository instead of `rhoas`. 


=== Updating GitHub action

The only changes you need to make to the `release.yaml` file to release to a custom container repository are link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L32[override the maven build] and link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L40[set the container index] image tag. Optionally you may wish to link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml#L17[disable the push] back to your main branch. `autoupdate.sh` creates a new git commit, and the action pushes it to main.



=== Updating update scripts

link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/olm/autoupdate.sh[autoupdate.sh] is responsible for updating the olm bundle. An OLM bundle is a versioned release of the operator. References to `quay.io/rhoas/` should be replaced with your organizations. 

link:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator/blob/main/olm/run_opm.sh[run_opm.sh] builds the index image. `quay.io/rhoas` references should be replaced here additionally.


=== Setting GitHub Variables

The build requires the following Secrets set in the GitHub repository :
 * quay_robotaccount - a username which can be used to push the olm metadata container, index container, and operator container
 * quay_robottoken - a password which can be used to push the olm metadata container, index container, and operator container
